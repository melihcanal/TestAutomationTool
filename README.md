# TestAutomationTool

## Project Structure

Node is required for generation and recommended for development. `package.json` is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and Webpack as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./mvnw
npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). We can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the TestAutomationTool application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by Jest. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```
